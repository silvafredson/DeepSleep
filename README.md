This project borned with my daugther's birth, We took a deep dive into fatherhood/motherhood and we come across on of the most common issue, the baby's sleep, I was graced with a baby who sleeps the whole night but during the day she had a lot of difficulty, through a research I did I saw that the vast majority of parents suffer from this issue of irregular sleep in their babies, and I then thought, how can I bild something that can help them? So I started the project using the CBL - Challenger Based Learning framework that guided me to this solution, a simple App with high quality relaxing sounds to help babies sleep better.
