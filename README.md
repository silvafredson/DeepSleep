DeepSleep is an iOS Application bilt in Swift language em SwiftUI framework.

This project borned with my daugther's birth, We took a deep dive into motherhood/fatherhood and we come across on of the most common issues, the baby's sleep but many of ours friends faced it, and I then thought, how can I bild something that can help them?

So I started the project using CBL - Challenger Based Learning framework who guide me to this Applicaton, a simple Application with high quality relaxing sounds to helps babys to better sleep
