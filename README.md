# DeepSleep


<br>

DeepSleep is an iOS Application bilt in Swift language em SwiftUI framework.

This project borned with my daugther's birth, We took a deep dive into motherhood/fatherhood and we come across on of the most common issues, the baby's sleep but many of ours friends faced it, and I then thought, how can I bild something that can help them? 

<br>
So I started the project using the CBL - Challenger Based Learning framework that guided me to this solution, a simple App with high quality relaxing sounds to help babies sleep better.
